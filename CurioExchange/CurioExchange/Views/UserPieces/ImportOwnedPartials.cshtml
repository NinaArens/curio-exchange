<h2>Import owned partials</h2>

<p>Input partial curios as they appear on CURIO SHOW PIECE @("<id>"). Be sure to include the title row, as well as the closing dashed line. The parser will only add the pieces listed as complete. Pieces not yet in the database will not be added, and you will be notified of this. Consider reporting them so that they may be added for future use!</p>
