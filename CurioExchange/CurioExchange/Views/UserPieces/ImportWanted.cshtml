<h2>Import wanted pieces</h2>

<p>Input partial curios as they appear on CURIO SHOW PIECE @("<id>"). Be sure to include the title row, as well as the closing dashed line. The parser will only add the pieces listed as missing. Pieces not yet in the database will not be added, and you will be notified off this. Consider reporting this so that they may be added for future use!</p>
